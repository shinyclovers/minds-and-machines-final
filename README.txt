MINDS AND MACHINES FINAL PROJECT - CONNECT 4 AI

INTRODUCTION
Connect 4 has been a fun game that playground kids enjoy playing. What's less
commonly known is the fact that Connect 4 is also a solved game, which means
when played optimally, the one of the players (player 1 in this case) will be
able to guarantee a win. The reason why we have chosen this project is due to the
fact that we believe we are competent enough coders that could code up some
suboptimal but still very good AI that can beat most people (and also because
of that fateful coinflip that professor John made). We were also interested in
answering the questions of how AI works. This connects with the AGI presentations
we have done during the class

PROGRAM
Our program is running a recursive search using the minimax algorithm.

RESULT
It's not smart
